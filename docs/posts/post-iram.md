There are good reasons to believe that web apps will begin to look more and more like native apps due to these technology trends:

**Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** — PWA are a website building methodology that enables website to be treated by the browser like an app, rather than an old school website. It enables web sites to have live updates, push notifications, launch the web site from the home screen, SEO discoverability, offline usage and more. This circumvents many of the reasons why users prefer apps, which will make it easier for publishers to engage users without the high friction need for app download. Some notable companies who shifted to PWA are AliExpress, The Financial Times and Lyft. Check out the video below to learn more about PWA.

**WebGL 2.0** — A javascript graphics library that enables rendering of high quality 3D graphics content on the browser. It is built on top of OpenGL ES (Embedded System) which allows it to use the mobile device’s GPU, which is a massive improvement compared to running it on the CPU. WebGL is supported by all major browsers which helps standardize web content creation.

**WebAssembly** — This is a new low level, Assembly-like, programming language that enables code written in non-javascript to run in the browser. It is efficient, lightning fast, and backward compatible with asm.js. Why is this so important? Wasm will enable graphics-heavy applications to run within the browser in native-like speed and fidelity.

**WebRTC** — Web Real Time Communication is a 5 year old standard that allows browsers to perform real time communications (in our case, access to the device’s camera and microphone), without relaying on 3rd party plugins such as Java, Flash, Silverlight which need to be updated regularly (due to security reasons). Not all mobile devices support WebRTC, but once they do, this would allow for a standardized way for developers to use Javascript libraries such as three.js and ar.js to enable real time AR experiences within a web app environment.
